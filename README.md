# Moneymoney Frollo extension

Integrates https://www.frollo.com.au into MoneyMoney

## What's working, what isn't?

This was built pretty quick so the chance of something not working is very high. My usecases (bank accounts and transactions) are covered, but other things like stocks and investments likely aren't yet.

## Install

Download the latest release from https://github.com/dvcrn/moneymoney-frollo-extension/releases and put it into your MoneyMoney extension folder

In MoneyMoney, enter your normal Frollo username and password

## Build from source

This was built with haxe and my quickstart template: https://github.com/dvcrn/haxe-moneymoney

- Install haxe
- Run `make`

## License

MIT, with commercial use excluded
